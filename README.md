# ðŸ“Š Social Media Impact on Real-Life Relationships â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores how social media usage affects various aspects of users' lives, particularly focusing on **mental health**, **real-life relationships**, and **communication habits**. Using a structured survey dataset, I conducted a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful patterns across age groups, occupations, platforms, and usage behaviors.

## ðŸ§  Key Questions Explored
- Does the time spent on social media impact mental health?
- Are real-life relationships affected by social media usage?
- Do students spend more time online than professionals?
- Is LinkedIn used only by urban professionals?
- Does using WhatsApp reduce email usage?

---

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Techniques Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Groupby Analysis, Crosstabs, and Chi-Square Tests
- Correlation Heatmaps and Regplots
- Visualizations: Bar Charts, Boxplots, Violin Plots, Pie Charts

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Highlights of the Analysis
- Most users spend 2â€“4 hours daily on social media.
- No strong correlation found between time spent and negative mental health.
- Relationship impact appears **independent of daily usage**â€”suggesting quality matters more than quantity.
- Both urban and rural professionals are present on LinkedIn, though urban usage dominates.
- WhatsApp and email are often used **together**, not as substitutes.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
- Add a Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration
- Apply simple classification models for predictive insights
- Clean pipeline scripts for reproducibility
